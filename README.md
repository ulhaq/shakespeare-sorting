# Sorting Algorithms
I have used the following five algorithms to sort Shakespeare's work:  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Heap Sort  
- Merge Sort  

*Before sorting the work, the content was sanitized, such that all words were lower-cased and punctuation was removed*

# Result
The following results are based on sorting the [Shakespeare_Short.txt](src/com/sorting/resources/Shakespeare_Short.txt)

|Algorithm|Time Complexity|Space Complexity|Time in Milliseconds|
|---|---|---|---|
|Selection Sort|O(n^2)|O(1)|3213|
|Insertion Sort|O(n^2)|O(1)|2329|
|Heap Sort|O(nLog(n))|O(1)|54|
|Merge Sort|O(nLog(n))|O(n)|48|
